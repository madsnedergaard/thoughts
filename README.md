# Thoughts

This repository serves as my second brain, digital garden, personal wiki.
In other words it's where I document thoughts, ideas and notes about topics that I'm learning about. 

Feel free to read, share and reach out to me if to share your own thoughts on these topics - I'd love to hear what you think :)

In the future I'll also make these notes appear on my personal website, but for now the goal is to write instead of code.
