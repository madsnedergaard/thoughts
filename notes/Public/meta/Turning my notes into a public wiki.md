Previous attempts:
- Gitbook --> didn't really work that well and it didn't sync well with the Obsidian note structure IMO
- Jekyll --> I tried a bunch of themes and starters, but I would like to structure notes based on folders - and I couldn't find a good way to do that!
	- Also, Liquid is fine for basic things, but quickly became a mess
