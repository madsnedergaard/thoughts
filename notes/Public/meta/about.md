# About this website

The goal of this project is the content. Making websites is fun and I love to spend time doing it, but it can also take too much time and I tend to focus too much on the structure and design instead of the content. Therefore I am using Gitbook for this website for now.

**A few "rules" for this project:**

* No analytics - goal is not visits
* No dates on content - it shouldn't matter when this was written, and I want everything to be updated regularly
* Target audience is me \(but hopefully others will benefit from it\)
