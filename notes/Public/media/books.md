# Books

I track all the books I read and want to read at [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16531967-mads-nedergaard).

Goals:

* Share which books I read and care about
* Help me be better at reflecting on what I'm reading during the reading process
* Keep my thoughts, ideas and citations around after I'm done with a book
* Hopefully point other people in direction
* Should not live on it's own, but rather be related to areas/topics
* if I have a note about a book I'm currently reading: highlight it

Rules:

* When I start a new book, I have to create a page for it!

There are however a few favorites I'd like to highlight:
