# Games

I like to occasionally play video games - although exclusively games I can play on the couch with a controller.

### Currently Playing

* Last Of Us Part II
* RÃ¶ki
* Cyberpunk 2077

## The best games I've ever played

**Gris**

A platform-adventure game about fear and pain.

Probably one of the most beautiful and emotional games I've ever played.

**Journey**

**The Witcher 3**

## Goals

What I'm looking for in games:

* Story-driven, slow-paced games
* Adventure/explorative games where I can do it in my own pace
* No competitive games \(I used to play a lot of Overwatch, but in the end it just makes me annoyed and unsatisfied\)
* No mobile games - I don't like "in-between-tasks" gaming, it should be concious choice and not just a way of getting time to pass.
