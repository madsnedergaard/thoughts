# TV shows

### Goals

#### Watch less mind-numbing TV shows

* Sit-coms, comedy, etc.
* They provide zero value except wasting time

#### Watch more high quality TV shows

* It can potentially be intellectually stimulating

#### But in general, watch less TV shows 

* As they drag out stories and add more useless "fillers" and action to make them longer
* They rarely have the same emotional or intellectual impact on me as movies does
  * There are few exceptions though



### Favourites

* Twin Peaks
* [Alone](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4803766/) \(both the Danish and American versions\)
* Devs
* American Gods
* Riget \(Danish\)
*
