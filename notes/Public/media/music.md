# Music

_I track all the music I have listened to on Spotify at_ [_Last.FM_](https://www.last.fm/user/MadsNedergaard)_._ 

## Music for work

I often listen to music when I need to focus while working. I usually have two different "modes": get-shit-done-mode and chill-mode.

### 1. Deep work aka. get shit done mode

#### Cercle Shows

DJ sets played and recorded live at unique locations. Beautiful, atmospheric videos. Usually deep house and electronics.

#### Spotify Playlist: work\('high'\)

My playlist with random music when I need to get in this mode. Not updated or used much these days thoughs.

### 2. Chill mode

When I'm working, but don't need to focus hard or I'm mostly just blocking out background noice.
