# Terminal Enhancements

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-02-18-at-10.25.40.png)

### My terminal setup

Terminal: [HyperJS](https://hyper.is/) 

Shell:[ zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) \(I have avoided `oh-my-zsh` and `prezto`as they were too slow\)

Prompt: [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure)

Theme: [hyper-snazzy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/hyper-snazzy)

#### Plugins

* zsh-syntax-highlighting
* zsh-you-should-use
* zsh-autosuggestions
* zsh-z

#### Environment management

* `NVM` for NodeJS
* `RVM` for Ruby
* `pyenv` for Python



### Tips & tricks

`ctrl+r` makes it possible to search for usage of a term - press `ctrl+r`again to go through results.

#### Github CLI

The  [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) is great! See [the manual](https://cli.github.com/manual/) for details.

* Checkout a forked PR: `gh pr checkout 1234`
