description: Customizing the touchbar to actually make it useful

# Touchbar

I'm using [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) for a lot of things, one of them is customizing the touchbar on my Macbook:

The default touchbar is fairly useless to me, I so very rarely use any of the buttons - especially when using an external keyboard. Therefore I've used BTT to customize it to mostly work as a second/third screen that displays the essentials.

### Items

1. Always-on `esc` key - it's always nice to have an escape key available
2. Media Player \(Spotify/Safari/Music\)
   * Shows currently playing, 
   * tapping it will play/pause, 
   * long press will skip current song
3. Empty space
   * Swiping with 2 fingers controls volume
   * Swiping with  3 fingers controls brightness
4. Volume slider - Easier access to quickly adjust it
5. Instant sleep button - will sleep the computer \(and require password when awoken\). Very useful when leaving the computer open somewhere where others have access
6. Do Not Disturb button - toggles DnD
7. Battery indicator
   * shows current battery status, 
   * if it's charging, 
   * changes colour if it's low
   * Long press open Activity Monitor
8. Time - just the time. Long press switches to normal Apple touchbar mode
