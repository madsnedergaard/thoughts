## Introduction

Hiring a developer is hard. Hiring a product manager might be even harder. These notes are a bunch of ideas on what to look for and how to ensure you don't end up with the wrong profile for your team.

## WIP Notes

### From the Stripe article:

4 types of product managers:
- business
- technical
- design
- growth

a **project manager** is not a **product manager**!
> Do not hire project managers as product managers. While project managers may be great at organizing and driving a schedule, they often lack the ability to prioritize features or ask the larger strategic questions.

#### Interview Questions
> What is a real world example where your company had multiple potential product paths to invest in but could not do all of them? How did you approach it?
- Prioritization
- data-driven decisions(?)
- team involvement (I did it on my own vs I made the decision together with the team)

> What is an example where a miscommunication caused an issue for a product? How was this resolved and what changed from a process perspective after?
- Ability to communicate
- Ability to reflect and learn from failures

> What metrics would the PM track for your companyâ€™s product? Why are those the right metrics?
- Avoiding [[vanity metrics]]



## Questions this note should answer
- What defines a good PM - and what defines a great PM?
- How do you interview for those skills?
