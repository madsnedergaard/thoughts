> “If you are not **embarrassed** by the **first version** of your product, you've launched too late.” — Reid Hoffman



* Focus everything on learning - the goal of the early versions is **to learn**...
  * if there is a product-market fit
  * if users understand and value your idea and solution
  * if the tech stack works and can support the use case
* Be focused—don’t try to solve every problem for every business
* Build an amazing product for a small group of people instead of a mediocre product for everyone
