# Workspace / office

* Encourage deep work
  * "deep work" rooms where you're not allowed to talk or opposite: "social" rooms where you can go work if you're doing light work and want to be talkative
  * Basecamp have **library rules** at the office
* Have plenty of small, cosy meetings rooms
  * This helps people avoid talking too much in the common office, but instead go somewhere else for that
  * Phone calls \(so it's not in the hallway\)
* No open floor bullshit
* Smaller rooms for deep uninterrupted thoughts + room for reading
