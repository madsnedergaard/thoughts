## Summary
Vanity metrics are **metrics that make you look good to others** but do not help you understand your own performance in a way that informs future strategies.

Good metrics makes it possible to answer these questions:
1. What business decision can we make with the metric?
2. What can we do to intentionally reproduce the result?
3. Is the data a real reflection of the truth?
