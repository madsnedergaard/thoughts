# Culture

* Culture is not "I want to drink beer with you" 
* Culture is not writing some values on a wall
* **Culture is your core values** - the values you will not give up, even if you're going to lose something on not doing it
* When hiring, you're looking for culture fit and if they believe in the same core values as you
* You cannot change peoples core values, so you **must** make sure they match when hiring - see also [\[Thoughts On hiring\]](Thoughts%20on%20hiring.md)
* Have a written plan for culture - and don't forget it!

> "Ask me anything" breakfast/lunch/dinner for new employees with the CEO/founders
