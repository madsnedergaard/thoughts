# Mentoring

### Ideas for good mentoring 

Have an onboarding buddy - ensures new team members have someone they can ask for help and who can introduce them to everything

Informal mentoring happens all the time - but formalising and scheduling it can help make it even better \(and make people grow faster\)

_"You're someone I look up to. Can I setup time to talk about areas I'd like to grow in and how you could potentially help, as a mentor?"_

### Initial agreement

Agree on the following aspects before starting:

* **Why** \(for both sides\) - what's in it for me?
* **Expectations** - make sure we're aligned on level of preparedness and approach
* **Focus areas** - where would you like to grow?
* **Cadence** - how often should we meet and when?
* **Communication** - how and how much should we communicate between catch-ups?

### Running docs

To make sure the time is not wasted for both parts, the mentee should always be prepared! A way of doing that, is to have a running document with notes. Example of what to write in the documents:

1. **Key things that happened since last time**

> I like to fill in mentor briefly on key things that happened since last time. I keep this short.

2. **Reflecting on action items / guidance / discussions from last time** 

> If I did something we talked about last time like tried out an approach, read a book, I share the results. This is useful for both of us, and my mentor gets to learn something interesting.

3. **A challenge I'm having** 

> talking through it and brainstorming on an approach to solve it.

4. **A recent success** **that I've had**

> I describe a situation I thought I handled well and why I thought it went well, asking my mentor to share what she thought of it. Nine out of ten times, I get feedback from a different angle, that make me re-evaluate how I'll handle the situation the next time.
